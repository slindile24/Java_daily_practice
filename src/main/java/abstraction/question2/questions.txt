Create an abstract class Animal:

Abstract method makeSound()

Concrete method void sleep() prints "Sleeping..."

Create Dog and Cat classes:

Override makeSound() ("Woof!" and "Meow!")

Add child-specific methods:

Dog has fetchBall()

Cat has scratchSofa()

In Main:

Create an array of Animal objects (mix of Dog and Cat)

Loop through and call makeSound() and sleep()

Use instanceof to downcast and call child-only methods

ðŸ“Œ You will practice:

Polymorphism

Downcasting with access to subclass methods
