Create an abstract class called Shape that has:

An abstract method double getArea()

A concrete method void display() that prints "Calculating area..."

Then, create a Circle class that:

Inherits from Shape

Has a field for radius

Implements the getArea() method (use formula: Ï€ * radius * radius)

In a Main class, create a Circle object, call display(), then call getArea() and print the result.
