You are building a system for an online store. Create a class called Product with the following fields:

name (String)

price (double)

Add appropriate getter and setter methods for these fields. Then, create a class called DiscountedProduct
that extends Product. This subclass should have an additional field:

discountPercentage (double)

The DiscountedProduct class should have a method applyDiscount() that applies the discount to the price of the product.

In the Main class, create a Product array that contains both regular products and discounted products. Loop through the
array and print the name and price of each product. For DiscountedProduct, also print the discounted price.

Ensure that all fields in both Product and DiscountedProduct are properly encapsulated (private) and accessed via getters
and setters.
